# Introduction to Data Wrangling and Visualization in Python

This repository contains the data and code for the short course titled *Introduction to Data Wrangling and Visualization in Python* taught at ASA DataFest 2024 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.

## Installing Python using `miniconda`

Miniconda is a lightweight distribution of Python and the `conda` package management system. Visit this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to install miniconda. Select your operating system and follow the instructions.

## Installing packages with `miniconda`

Once you have miniconda installed and the prompt launched, you are ready to install the packages we will need. These packages are 

* NumPy (`numpy`)
* Pandas (`pandas`)
* Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
* Jupyter Lab (`jupyterlab`)

You can install these in one command by running

```{bash}
conda install -y numpy pandas matplotlib jupyterlab
```

## Launching Jupyter Lab

Once you have the packages above installed, you can launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the conda prompt:

```{bash}
jupyter lab
```

This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter Lab application.

## Downloading and Opening the Notebook 

Click on the green "Code" button at the top of this page and then click "Download ZIP". Go to your downloads folder and unzip the file. Then either leave the unzipped folder there or move it somewhere else. Either way, navigate to the location of the folder in Jupyter Lab and click on the file `Intro-Python.ipynb` to open the notebook we will use for the remainder of this short course.
